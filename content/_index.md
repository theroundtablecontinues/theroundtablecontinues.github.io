Welcome to the new initiative of *The Roundtable Continues*, the collective effort of five friends all speaking at [Game Developers Conference 2023]. As we started preparing to head to GDC, we realized we wanted to document the discussions we'll have and keep those conversations going. This website, [The Roundtable Continues], is our hub.

While you're here, check out what we're up to at [GDC23] and the latest [news]. We'd also love for you to connect with us by [email].

Let's work on something together soon, and keep the conversations going!
